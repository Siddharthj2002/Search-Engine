## Time Spent
I spent almost one entire hour on this project

## Thoughts about this project
I feel that this is a very apt strting project for this class. 
Not too complicated and everything is explained in a very understandable manner.
The only  thing I was a little confused about would be the String comparison but I got that sorted too.
